# Scientific-Calculator
Creates a functional scientific calculator with 12 functions.
This was created as a project for a software engineering class at UNCC.
I was Given a python program which implements a basic Calculator performing basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) that checked for division by 0. 
I converted this to a scientific calculator able to perform ^, r, %, !, sin, cos, tan, and ln functions.
